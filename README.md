# climate-risk-explorer

Climate Risk Explorer is an open-source web platform that helps individuals, communities, and planners understand the long-term climate and natural disaster risks tied to any address. By simply entering a location, users can explore an interactive map with toggleable layers showing a wide range of hazards — including floods, wildfires, heatwaves, air quality, windstorms, earthquakes, tornadoes, and soil erosion.

What sets this project apart is its personalized, data-driven insights: the platform not only displays current risk conditions, but also offers 50-year projections based on the latest climate models and hazard trends — all in one place.

🔍 Key Features
📍 Address Search: Zoom directly to any address and view its risk profile

🗺️ Multi-Hazard Map Layers: Toggle between 8+ risk layers (flood, fire, wind, etc.)

⏳ 50-Year Projections: See how climate change may affect the area in coming decades

💬 Interactive & Clickable: Click map areas for detailed risk insights

📖 Open Source: Built for transparency, learning, and community collaboration

🔌 Modular & Extensible: Designed to support new data sources, visualizations, and APIs

🚀 Why This Project Matters
Climate risks are rising, but clear, localized information is hard to access — and often locked behind paywalls or limited tools. Climate Risk Explorer democratizes access to climate hazard data by combining:

Precise, address-level insights

Scientific forecasts

User-friendly, open-source tech

Whether you're a resident trying to understand the risks to your home, a local policymaker preparing for future disasters, or a developer eager to improve resilience tools — this platform is for you.
